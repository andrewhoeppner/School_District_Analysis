# School_District_Analysis
## The purpose of this analysis is to help Maria show high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format. Also give an overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format. The key metrics being:
*Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
*The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
*The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
*School performance based on the budget per student
*School performance based on the school size 
*School performance based on the type of school
With all of this information Maria can then make a decision on how to disburse funding for next year to the schools and in what areas they should spend more or less money.

Maria had me remove some data from the analysis due to evidence of acaemic dishonesty. After removing said data i have found, it made no difference in the results in terms of top 5 or bottom 5. Althrough it did boost Thomas High School % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing enough that they passed up a couple other schools on the list. But with Thomas High School and the schools it may have passed due to data corrections being in the middle of the data set it really didnt affect anything at all in the data set in terms of the finall conclusion.
##Summary
Althrough the data correction changed Thomas High Schools % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing, the top 5 and bottom 5 schools stayed strong in there placements.
